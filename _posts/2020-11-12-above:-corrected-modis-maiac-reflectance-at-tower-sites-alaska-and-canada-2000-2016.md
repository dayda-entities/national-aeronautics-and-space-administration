This dataset provides angular corrections of MODIS Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction algorithm (MAIAC) surface reflectances by two methods at each of 62 flux tower sites (1 km x 1 km area) across the ABoVE domain in Alaska and western Canada from 2000 to 2015/2016. The original MAIAC reflectance data were corrected to consistent view and illumination angles (0 degree view zenith angle and 45 degree of sun zenith angle) using two independent algorithms: the first based on the original BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) parameters provided by the MAIAC team, and the second based on a machine learning approach (random forests). The corrected data preserve the original MAIAC data's sub-daily temporal resolution and 1 km spatial resolution with seven land bands (bands 1-7) and five ocean bands (bands 8-12). The resulting tower site sub-daily timeseries of angular corrected surface reflectances are suitable for long-term studies on patterns, processes, and dynamics of surface phenomena.
