  Distributed, Passivity-Based, Aeroservoelastic Control (DPASC) of Structurally
  Efficient Aircraft in the Presence of Gusts, Phase II
notes: >-
  Control of extremely lightweight, long endurance aircraft poses a challenging
  aeroservoelastic (ASE) problem due to significantly increased flexibility, and
  aerodynamic, structural, and actuator nonlinearities. To obtain the benefits
  of increased aerostructural efficiency, the controller needs to trim at a
  specified optimal shape while minimizing structural fatigue from gust
  disturbances. Tao Systems, Texas A&M University and University of Minnesota
  propose to develop a distributed, passivity-based, ASE controller (DPASC)
  using sectional aerodynamic and structural output-only feedback. This scalable
  approach has the potential to minimize the impact of aerodynamic / structural
  uncertainties and control surface free-play / saturation, while guaranteeing
  global asymptotic stability.
