This data set describes the temperature and relative humidity at 12 locations around Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt MD at 15 minute intervals between November 2013 and November 2015. These data were collected to study the impact of surface type on heating in a campus setting and to improve the understanding of urban heating and potential mitigation strategies on the campus scale. Sensors were mounted on posts at 2 m above surface and placed on 7 different surface types around the centre: asphalt parking lot, bright surface roof, grass field, forest, and stormwater mitigation features (bio-retention pond and rain garden). Data were also recorded in an office setting and a garage, both pre- and post-deployment, for calibration purposes. This dataset could be used to validate satellite-based study or could be used as a stand-alone study of the impact of surface type on heating in a campus setting.
