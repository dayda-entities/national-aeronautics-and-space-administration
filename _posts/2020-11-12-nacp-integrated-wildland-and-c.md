The data set provides a 30-m comprehensive fuelbed characteristics map for both the wildland and cropland areas of the conterminous United States (CONUS) for 2010. This integrated product is the result of combining the spatially discrete Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) data of the US Forest Service (USFS) with the crop-and grassland-specific information of the US Department of Agricultures (USDA's) Cropland Data Layer (CDL).  By combining the spatially discrete details of the FCCS data set with the crop-and grassland-specific information of the CDL, a more robust map of fuelbed characteristics is available. The merged product has an advantage over the original FCCS map for estimating emissions from burned areas due to the integration of the fuelbed characteristics for agricultural areas from the CDL.There are three GeoTIFF format files and three comma-separated companion files distributed with this data set. The three tif files provided are very large and exceed the size limits of a standard GeoTIFF file format (4 GB). File sizes range from 20 to 30 GB. Compressed file sizes range from 2 to 3 GB. They are in a format that is called a BigTIFF file. ArcGIS 10.0 and ERDAS Imagine are able to read these files.
