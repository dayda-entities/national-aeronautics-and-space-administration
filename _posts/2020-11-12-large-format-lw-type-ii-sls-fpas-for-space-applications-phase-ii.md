This Phase II SBIR proposes to further develop high performance (low dark current, high quantum efficiency, and low NEdT) infrared epitaxy materials based on Type II Strained Layer Superlattice (SLS) for large format space-based sensor applications. The epi materials will be grown with Sb-capable multi-wafer production Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) reactor at IntelliEPI-IR. The initial goal includes achieving QE of at least 40% with LWIR spectral wavelength band near 12 Âµm.  The SLS detector design will be developed in consultation with the infrared detector group at JPL to ensure that this effort addresses NASA needs. Materials for prototype high-performance LWIR Focal Plane Array (FPA) will be demonstrated during the Phase II effort.
