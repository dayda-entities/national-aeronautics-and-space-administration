Cryogenic fluid valves are subject to harsh exposure and actuators to drive these valves require robust performance and high reliability.  DSM's piezoelectric actuators offer advantages over traditional alternative actuator technology.  However, in order to use piezoceramic actuators in cryogenic fluid handling applications, proof of operational reliability and improvements in thermal neutral response are required.  During the Phase I, DSM experienced great successes and found multiple compelling reasons to continue into Phase II. Particular successes include: gaining access to a new piezoceramic material with superior cryogenic performance, demonstrating a flight-like vibration test survivability level for a small actuator sample set, and, development of a novel composite actuator with excellent neutral thermal response. The outcome of the Phase I yields multiple compelling reasons to continue into Phase 2.  The potential for application of this actuator technology to cryogenic fluid valves is substantial with interested NASA advisors at NASA JSC, MSFC, and GRC.
